## Overveiw the project
___
*The purpose of our project was to analyze two months of the year - June and December - according to temperature data in the city of Oahu in Hawaii. This will serve to decide if the surf and ice cream business is of year-round interest.*

## Resources
___
   + Data Source: hawaii.sqlite
   + Software: SQLite, SQLAlchemy, Flask, Jupyter Notebook

## Summary
___
For a clear answer, we must dive into the world of surfing ourselves to understand what is good and what is bad, when it's comfortable and when it's not! With ice cream it's easier, hot - it's in your hands!

*Perhaps this is one of the indispensable things in data analysis - to completely immerse yourself in the problem or the issue with which you are working, as they say - `"get into his shoes."`*

So getting back to surfing issues - according to data obtained from the Internet, the comfortable temperature for surfing is on average 70, 80 is too hot, 60 requires special equipment. Now let's take a look at our data!
In the coldest month of December - we can see that temperatures range from 56-69 for about one week. Thats not too bad. The colder weather may drive sales for wetsuits and other related gear, which is good for business. However, ice cream sales may not be as rewarding.

June presents almost the opposite with the hottest week of the month randing from 77 to 85 degrees. This is good for ice cream sales to cool those who may get uncomfortable in the higher temperatures.

Probably on the Internet you can find a map of surfing all over the world and use it to make sure that Oahu is one of those places on the planet where the surf and ice cream business can flourish all year round! But in order to look like professionals, we will do another dive into the data and pull out information on precipitation in June and December from there. And `voil√†`!

### Precipitation in June
 + average is  0.14 mm
+ precipitation range 0 - 4.43 mm 
+ majority of the month precipitation is less than 0.12 mm

###  After we analyzed both the temperature and precipitation for the two most risky months of June and December, there is no doubt that Oahu, Hawaii location is suitable for the surf and ice cream business all over the year!
